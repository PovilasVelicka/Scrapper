## üöÄ How to Run (from Scratch)

If you're opening this project for the first time and your computer isn't set up for Python development, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Python

- Go to [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Download and install the latest Python 3 version
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to check **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation

### 2. Download or Clone the Repository

If you have Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PovilasVelicka/Scrapper.git
cd Scrapper
```

Or download the ZIP from GitHub, extract it, and open the folder in your terminal or command prompt.

### 3. Create Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

- On **Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configure the Scraper

Edit the `config.json` file to:

- Set the IKEA category URL to scrape
- Choose the output format
- Configure logging level, delay interval, etc.

Example `config.json`:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": "DEBUG"
  },
  "DataBase": {
    "FilePath": ".\\DB\\virtuves-sistema-metod.jsonl"
  },
  "Scrapping":{
    "Url": "https://www.ikea.lt/lt/products/virtuve/virtuves-sistema-metod",
    "Interval": 2
  }
}
```

### 6. Run the Scraper

```bash
python app.py
```

---

## ü™µ Logging

Logging behavior is controlled by the `LogLevel` setting in `config.json`. Example:

```json
"Logging": {
  "LogLevel": "DEBUG"
}
```

Use "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", or "ERROR" depending on how detailed you want the logs. If LogLevel is set to "DEBUG", logging will be done in the console. If set to a higher level, logs will be saved to a file in the logs directory, organized by the date of logging.

## üìß Optional: Email Notification on Completion

If you want to send an email notification when the process finishes (e.g. with a report or summary), follow these steps:

### 1. Add Gmail credentials to `.env`

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following:
```text
GMAIL_USERNAME=your.email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_app_password_here
```
- Use a **Gmail App Password**, not your regular Gmail password.
- You can generate an App Password in your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/security) under **Security ‚Üí App passwords** (2FA must be enabled).
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to version control.

### 2. Define recipients in `config.json`

Add a `MailService` block to your `config.json` file. You can provide multiple email addresses separated by ; or , for example:

```json
{
  "MailService": {
    "Recipients": "user1@example.com; user2@example.com"
  }
}
```
### 3. Automatic email on process completion
If both .env and MailService.Recipients are configured, the system will send an email with the result, report, or log file when the process completes.
