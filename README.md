### 5. Configure the Scraper

Edit the `config.json` file to:

- Set the IKEA category URL to scrape
- Choose the output format
- Configure logging level, delay interval, etc.

Example `config.json`:

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": "DEBUG"
  },
  "DataBase": {
    "FilePath": ".\\DB\\virtuves-sistema-metod.jsonl"
  },
  "Scrapping":{
    "Url": "https://www.ikea.lt/lt/products/virtuve/virtuves-sistema-metod",

## ü™µ Logging

Logging behavior is controlled by the `LogLevel` setting in `config.json`. Example:

```json
"Logging": {
  "LogLevel": "DEBUG"
}
```

Use "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", or "ERROR" depending on how detailed you want the logs. If LogLevel is set to "DEBUG", logging will be done in the console. If set to a higher level, logs will be saved to a file in the logs directory, organized by the date of logging.
